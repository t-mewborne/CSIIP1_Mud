## Show Code #1 on 1/31 (4 of 4 points)

Compiled and ran. I felt that the way it ran was smooth and it took my commands the way I wanted to type them.
I'm not big on printing both invetory and room items after every get/drop, but that's a design choice that you
can keep if you like it.

## Show Code #3 on 2/19 (4 of 4 points)

Code compiles and runs fine. Rooms are storedin a Map. You made exits be the Buffer, which seems like an odd 
choice since you are never adding to or removing from the exits and that is the advantage of a Buffer. I also
found a bug in item handling that I left two comments on.

## Show Code #7 on 3/28 (4 of 4 points)

Code compiles and runs as expected.
